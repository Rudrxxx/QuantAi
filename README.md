# 🎤 Uncovering Zipf’s Law in Billie Eilish Lyrics

Welcome to our AI Fundamentals project repository!  
This project explores the fascinating **Zipf’s Law** in the context of human language — specifically within the **lyrics of Billie Eilish**.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal

To apply **Zipf’s Law** to real-world text data (song lyrics) and investigate if Billie Eilish's songwriting aligns with the natural frequency-rank distribution of words found in most human language.

> "If words had a rhythm beyond rhyme, Zipf might be the beat they follow."

---

## 📊 What's Zipf’s Law?

Zipf’s Law states that in a naturally occurring dataset of words:
- The **most frequent word** appears about **twice** as often as the second most frequent word.
- The **third most frequent** occurs **1/3** as often, and so on.
- This leads to a **log-log plot** where frequency ∝ 1/rank, forming a roughly straight line.

## 🔍 Our Workflow

1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Normalized and tokenized lyrics  
   - Removed punctuation and common stopwords

2. **Frequency Analysis**  
   - Counted the frequency of each word  
   - Assigned ranks based on descending frequency  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted word frequency distribution  
   - Generated **log-log plots** to test Zipf’s Law  
   - Created word clouds and bar charts for EDA

4. **Interpretation**  
   - Analyzed how closely Billie Eilish’s lyrics conform to Zipf’s Law  
   - Compared song-wise frequency anomalies  
   - Discussed possible reasons for deviation (if any)
