What's This Project About?
We dove into the lyrics of Billie Eilish to explore how her songwriting lines up with Zipf’s Law—a fascinating pattern in language where a few words get used a lot, and most words are rare. Using data science, we broke down her lyrical style, word usage, and how her words reflect emotion, minimalism, and repetition.
